# Video Face Manipulation Detection Through Ensemble of CNNs
![](assets/faces_attention.png)

This is the official repository of *Video Face Manipulation Detection Through Ensemble of CNNs*,
submitted to [ICPR2020](https://www.micc.unifi.it/icpr2020/) and currently available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07676).

We participate as *ISPL* team on [Kaggle Deepfake Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/).
With this implementation, we reached the top 2% on the [private leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/leaderboard).
## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Create the `icpr2020` environment with *environment.yml*
```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate icpr2020
```

### Dataset preprocessing
You need to preprocess dataset in order to index all the samples and extract faces. Just run the script [make_dataset.sh](scripts/make_dataset.sh)

```bash
$ ./scripts/make_dataset.sh
```

Please notice that we use only 32 frames per video. You can tweak easily tweak this parameter in [extract_faces.py](extract_faces.py)

### Train
In [train_all.sh](scripts/train_all.sh) you can find a comprehensive list of all the commands for training the models presented in the paper. 
Please refer to the comments into the script for hints on their usage.

### Test 
In [test_all.sh](scripts/test_all.sh) you can find a comprehensive list of all the commands for testing the models presented in the paper. 


Additionally, you can find notebooks for results computations  in the [notebook](notebook) folder.
